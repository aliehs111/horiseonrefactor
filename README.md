# horiseonrefactor
refactor code for horiseon

## Description

This is a first project in bootcamp class.  The goal was to refactor the html/css code to make the webpage meet accessibilty standards and proper html semantic structure.

-First the html code was structured and semantic tags were added
-Then the CSS was organized to match the sematic tags and structure
-A missing nav link was fixed
-The title was made more specific 
-CSS was consolidated to reduce some idential code lines
-Typos were fixed
-Alts were added for images

## Challenges and Opportunities

There was some code that was easy to fix and immediately noticeable.  There was also a fair amount of trial and error when trying to change the classes on the tags to consolidate the CSS.
I would have liked to consolidate more of the styling but on several attempts, I created other problems I was unable to solve.
Each mistep was an opportuity to learn more about how the code works.  I enjoyed the process and look forward to learning more. 
Github was by far the biggest distraction to completing the project sooner.
